## Hello, I'm Phil!
 I'm a Python developer with a passion for finance, large language models, and web development. I'm proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and enjoy building responsive and user-friendly websites.

I'm new to this space and I'm eager to find opportunities that will allow me to use my skills and build a successful career. I'm always looking for new challenges and projects that will help me grow as a developer and provide me with the financial stability I need to pursue my passions.

In addition to coding, I'm also passionate about environmental issues and climate change. I believe that technology can play a key role in addressing these challenges, and I'm excited to be part of a community that's working towards a better future.

If you're interested in working with me or have any questions, feel free to reach out! I'm always happy to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities.
