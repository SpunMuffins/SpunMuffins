## 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile.

👨‍💻 I'm a budding programmer interested in Python, web development, and the intersection of finance and technology. I'm exploring different opportunities to grow my skills and knowledge in these areas.

🌍 I'm passionate about the environment and want to do my part in addressing climate change. I believe that technology can play a critical role in creating sustainable solutions, and I'm eager to learn more about how I can contribute.

💼 I'm currently looking for entry-level opportunities where I can learn and grow as a programmer. I'm excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals and organizations that are working towards making a positive impact on the world.

📚 When I'm not coding, you'll often find me reading about programming concepts or learning new skills through online courses and tutorials. I believe that continuous learning is key to becoming a successful programmer, and I'm always looking for new resources to help me improve.

📫 If you're interested in connecting or have any tips for a beginner like me, please feel free to reach out. I'm open to advice and feedback from experienced programmers who can help guide me on my journey.

Let's work together towards a brighter, greener future! 🌱🌍
